-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, first identify all entities needed from the text in order to capture the information and ideas in the text.
Next, report all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in Chinese as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. If you have to translate into Chinese, just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.

。他下了木筏，登上了岸，看见岸边有许多人都在干活，有的捉鱼，有的打天上的大雁，有的挖蛤蜊，有的淘盐，他悄悄地走过去，没想到，吓得那些人将东西一扔，四处逃命。
　　这一天，他来到一座高山前，突然从半山腰的树林里传出一阵美妙的歌声，唱的是一些关于成仙的话。猴王想∶这个唱歌的人一定是神仙，就顺着歌声找去

I can provide you with the output in the required format. However, please note that the input text is quite long and contains multiple entities, relationships, and formatting instructions.

Here is the output:

**Entities:**

1. **木筏**: A wooden boat.
2. **岸**: The shore or coastline.
3. **人**: People.
4. **捉鱼**: Fishing.
5. **打天上的大雁**: Shooting at birds in flight (likely a metaphor for hunting).
6. **挖蛤蜊**: Digging for shellfish.
7. **淘盐**: Raking salt from the sea.
8. **神仙**: Supernatural beings or gods.

**Relationships:**

1. **木筏 ->岸**: The boat was on the shore.
2. **岸 ->人**: There were people on the shore.
3. **人 ->捉鱼**: Some people were fishing.
4. **人 ->打天上的大雁**: Others were hunting birds.
5. **人 ->挖蛤蜊**: Some people were digging for shellfish.
6. **人 ->淘盐**: Others were raking salt from the sea.
7. **神仙 ->歌声**: The singing was attributed to a supernatural being.
8. **猴王 ->神仙**: The monkey king thought the singer was a god.

**Formatting Instructions:**

1. Use a fixed-width font (e.g., Courier) for all text output.
2. Use Markdown formatting for headings, bold text, and italics.
3. Use a consistent indentation scheme for block-level elements (e.g., lists, paragraphs).

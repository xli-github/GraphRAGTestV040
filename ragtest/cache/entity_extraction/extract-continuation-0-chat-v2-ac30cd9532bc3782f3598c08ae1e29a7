'You're not taking this seriously enough,' he said. 'You're just playing around with your powers.' He chased Wukong away, telling him never to come back.\n\nBut the Patriarch's anger was also a sign of his love for his son. He knew that Wukong had the potential to become a great Buddhist master and achieve immortality through the method he taught him.\n\nThe Patriarch took Wukong under his wing and taught him everything he knew. He showed him how to meditate, how to cultivate compassion, and how to achieve enlightenment. Wukong was a quick learner, and soon he became one of the most skilled Buddhist masters in the land.\n\nYears passed, and Wukong became known as the Monkey King, a legendary figure who could transform into various forms and achieve incredible feats.

The story highlights the Monkey King's eagerness to learn and his desire to become immortal. However, when he fails to understand or follow instructions, his master becomes angry and disciplines him.\n\nThe text also shows the Monkey King's mischievous side, as he uses his magical powers to transform into a tree and impress his friends. Despite this, he is scolded by his master for not taking his spiritual practice seriously enough.\n\nOverall, the story emphasizes the importance of discipline, respect, and humility in spiritual practice, as well as the challenges faced by those who seek enlightenment.\n\n**Translation:**\n\nHere is a translation of the text:\n\n\"The Water-Picking Life\n\nIt had been seven years since the lecture ended. The Master asked Wukong what he wanted to learn. Wukong didn't care about the lectures on Buddhism or meditation; he only wanted to know how to live forever. The Patriarch was furious.\n\nHe jumped down from the high platform, holding his staff and pointing at Wukong. 'What do you want to learn?' he shouted. He walked away, striking Wukong three times with his staff. Then he closed the door behind him.\n\nThe other disciples saw their master's anger and were afraid. They blamed Wukong for causing trouble. But Wukong was not afraid; he was actually happy.\n\nThat night, when everyone had gone to bed, Wukong snuck out of the front gate. He waited until three o'clock, then crept up to the back door. When it creaked open, he slipped inside.\n\nInside, he found his master fast asleep. Wukong bowed down and said, 'Master, I'm waiting for you!' The Master woke up and sat cross-legged on his bed. He asked Wukong what he wanted.\n\nWukong replied, 'You promised me that if I came at three o'clock, you would teach me the secret to immortality.' The Master was pleased. He thought to himself, 'This monkey is indeed a clever one.'\n\nHe taught Wukong the method for immortality and told him to remember it well. Three years passed, and the Master taught Wukong seventy-two different transformations and the art of driving clouds.\n\nWukong became very skilled at this. One summer, he and his friends were playing in front of the cave entrance when they asked him to transform into something. Wukong was happy to oblige and transformed into a giant tree.\n\nThe disciples cheered and clapped for him. But the Patriarch heard them and came out, scolding them for their noise. When he saw Wukong back to normal, he was furious again.\n\n'You're not taking this seriously enough,' he said. 'You're just playing around with your powers.' He chased Wukong away, telling him never to come back.\"\n\nPlease note that the translation is not perfect and may vary depending on the context and interpretation of the original text."}]}
